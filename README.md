# IR-Wireless-Under-Water-Communication-System

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing an Infrared (IR) based wireless underwater communication system. The system enables short-range data transmission through water using IR signals and helps in understanding the challenges of underwater communication such as signal attenuation and noise.
This is a hardware-based ECE project, supported with physical model implementation and detailed documentation.

🎯 Objective
To study underwater communication techniques
To implement short-range data transmission using IR technology
To analyze signal behavior in water medium
To understand practical challenges in underwater wireless communication

⚙️ System Description
The system consists of an IR transmitter and an IR receiver.
The transmitter sends modulated IR signals through water, and the receiver detects and converts them back into electrical signals. The received data is then processed to verify successful communication.

🧩 Components Used
IR Transmitter (IR LED)
IR Receiver (Photodiode / IR Sensor)
Microcontroller (if applicable)
Driver Circuit
Power Supply
Resistors, Capacitors
Connecting Wires and Water Tank (for testing)

🛠️ Working Principle
Input data is given to the IR transmitter
IR LED emits infrared signals through water
Signals travel through the underwater medium
IR receiver detects the incoming signal
The received signal is processed to retrieve the data

📊 Results
Successfully demonstrated underwater IR communication
Observed signal attenuation in water medium
Verified short-range data transmission
